// Function that formats user details using template literals
// ES6+ Feature: Arrow Function
// This is a concise way to declare a function. It uses the `=>` syntax and does not have its own `this` context.
const formatUserDetails = (name, age, occupation) => {
    // ES6+ Feature: Template Literals
   
    return `Hello, my name is ${name}. I am ${age} years old and I work as a ${occupation}.`;
  };
  // Example usage
  // ES6+ Feature: const
  // `const` declares variables that cannot be reassigned, ensuring their values remain constant.
  const userName = "Sara";
  const userAge = 23;
  const userOccupation = "Software Developer";
  
  
  // The function is called with the values of `userName`, `userAge`, and `userOccupation` passed as arguments.
  const userDetails = formatUserDetails(userName, userAge, userOccupation);
  
  
  // The formatted string returned by the function is logged to the console.
  console.log(userDetails);
